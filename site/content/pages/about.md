## Let's play some pinball!

---

I have been playing pinball competitively for about a year in total. I started playing at local pubs in Phoenix, Arizona during the summer of 2019. First tournament I participated in was a monthly knockout at Electric Bat in Tempe, Arizona. I placed 20th and had a great time even beating players ranked in the top 10 on IFPA for Arizona.</p>
<p>I have since competed in 20 different weekly or monthly tournaments in Arizona. You can see my current rank and active results [here]("https://www.ifpapinball.com/player.php?p=78686#active").

Sincerely,
